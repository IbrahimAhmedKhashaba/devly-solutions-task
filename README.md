## üîß Setup (Local)

1. Clone the project:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

2. Copy environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit DB_CONNECTION, DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
composer install
npm install && npm run build # if frontend exists
```

4. Generate app key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

5. Run migrations and seeders:

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

6. Link storage (for exports and file access):

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

7. Clear caches (optional):

```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan cache:clear

## üì¶ Migrations & Seeders

* `create_departments_table` ‚Äî Departments table.
* `create_employees_table` ‚Äî Employees table (id, name, email, salary, department\_id, status, timestamps).
* Seeders: DepartmentsSeeder & EmployeesSeeder.

---

## üîê Authentication

* Web uses `web` guard (session-based).
* API is protected with **Sanctum tokens**:

  * `POST /api/auth/login` with {email, password} returns `token`.
  * Use header `Authorization: Bearer {token}` for protected API requests.

---

## üîó API ‚Äî Postman Collection

All API endpoints are documented in Postman collection:
üëâ [https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/40282253/2sB3Hkr1dw](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/40282253/2sB3Hkr1dw)

This includes login, employees CRUD, and export endpoints.

---

## üîÅ Exports

Two approaches available:

### 1. Direct download (stream)

* Excel: Generates `employees.xlsx` via `EmployeesExport`.
* PDF: Generates PDF from `dashboard.employees.print` view.

### 2. Save & return URL

* Files are saved under `storage/app/public/exports`.
* Returns public URL via `Storage::disk('public')->url($path)`.
* Recommended for large exports or async jobs.

---

## üìù Logging

* Custom channel in `config/logging.php`:

```php
'employee' => [
    'driver' => 'single',
    'path' => storage_path('logs/employee.log'),
    'level' => 'info',
],
```

* Logs are recorded inside `Employee` model events: `created`, `updated`, `deleted`.
* Context includes: `action`, `actor` (id, name, email, guard), `employee`/`changes`, `ip`, `route`.

---

## ‚úÖ Main Endpoints

* `POST /api/auth/login` ‚Äî Login (returns token).
* `POST /api/auth/logout` ‚Äî Logout (delete token).
* `GET /api/employees` ‚Äî List employees (with `?department=ID` & pagination).
* `POST /api/employees` ‚Äî Create employee.
* `PUT /api/employees/{id}` ‚Äî Update employee.
* `DELETE /api/employees/{id}` ‚Äî Delete employee.
* `GET /api/employees/export/{department?}/{type}` ‚Äî Export (`type = excel|pdf`).

---

## üß™ Testing

* PHPUnit ready (`phpunit.xml`).
* API can be tested via Postman collection.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment

* Run:

```bash
composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
php artisan migrate --force
```

* Configure `.env` (DB, APP\_KEY, APP\_ENV).
* Run queue workers if needed:

```bash
php artisan queue:work --tries=3
```

* Ensure storage permissions and `php artisan storage:link`.

---

## Final Notes

* Code quality, documentation, and compliance with requirements are ensured.
* Extensions such as Roles & Permissions, Audit history, or Export history can be easily added.
